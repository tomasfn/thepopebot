# Why thepopebot?

**The repository IS the agent** — Every action your agent takes is a git commit. You can see exactly what it did, when, and why. If it screws up, revert it. Want to clone your agent? Fork the repo — code, personality, scheduled jobs, full history, all of it goes with your fork.

**Free compute, built in** — Every GitHub account comes with free cloud computing time. thepopebot uses that to run your agent. One task or a hundred in parallel — the compute is already included.

**Self-evolving** — The agent modifies its own code through pull requests. Every change is auditable, every change is reversible. You stay in control.

You interact with your bot via the web chat interface or Telegram (optional). The Event Handler creates a job branch. GitHub Actions spins up a Docker container with the Pi coding agent. The agent does the work, commits the results, and opens a PR. Auto-merge handles the rest. You get a notification when it's done.

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Install |
|-------------|---------|
| **Node.js 18+** | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| **npm** | Included with Node.js |
| **Git** | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) |
| **GitHub CLI** | [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com) |
| **Docker + Docker Compose** | [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (installer requires admin password) |
| **ngrok*** | [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/download) (free account + authtoken required) |

*\*ngrok is only required for local installs without port forwarding. VPS/cloud deployments don't need it. [Sign up](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) for a free ngrok account, then run `ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_TOKEN>` before starting setup.*

### Three steps

**Step 1** — Scaffold a new project:

```bash
mkdir my-agent && cd my-agent
npx thepopebot@latest init
```

This creates a Next.js project with configuration files, GitHub Actions workflows, and agent templates. You don't need to create a GitHub repo first — the setup wizard handles that.

**Step 2** — Run the setup wizard:

```bash
npm run setup
```

The wizard walks you through everything:
- Checks prerequisites (Node.js, Git, GitHub CLI)
- Creates a GitHub repository and pushes your initial commit
- Creates a GitHub Personal Access Token (scoped to your repo)
- Collects API keys (Anthropic required; OpenAI, Brave optional)
- Sets GitHub repository secrets and variables
- Generates `.env`
- Builds the project

**Step 3** — Start your agent:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- **Web Chat**: Visit your APP_URL to chat with your agent, create jobs, upload files
- **Telegram** (optional): Run `npm run setup-telegram` to connect a Telegram bot
- **Webhook**: Send a POST to `/api/create-job` with your API key to create jobs programmatically
- **Cron**: Edit `config/CRONS.json` to schedule recurring jobs

> **Local installs**: Your server needs to be reachable from the internet for GitHub webhooks and Telegram. On a VPS/cloud server, your APP_URL is just your domain. For local development, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) (`ngrok http 80`) or port forwarding to expose your machine.
>
> **If your ngrok URL changes** (it changes every time you restart ngrok on the free plan), you must update APP_URL everywhere:
>
> ```bash
> # Update .env and GitHub variable in one command:
> npx thepopebot set-var APP_URL https://your-new-url.ngrok.io
> # If Telegram is configured, re-register the webhook:
> npm run setup-telegram
> ```

## Manual Updating

**1. Update the package**

```bash
npm install thepopebot@latest
```

**2. Scaffold and update templates**

```bash
npx thepopebot init
```

For most people, that's it — `init` handles everything. It updates your project files, runs `npm install`, and updates `THEPOPEBOT_VERSION` in your local `.env`. See [Understanding `init`](#understanding-init) below for details on what this updates and how to handle custom changes.

**3. Rebuild for local dev**

```bash
npm run build
```

**4. Commit and push**

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "upgrade thepopebot to vX.X.X"
git push
```

Pushing to `main` triggers the `rebuild-event-handler.yml` workflow on your server. It detects the version change, runs `thepopebot init`, updates `THEPOPEBOT_VERSION` in the server's `.env`, pulls the new Docker image, restarts the container, rebuilds `.next`, and reloads PM2 — no manual `docker compose` needed.

### Understanding `init`

#### How your project is structured

When you ran `thepopebot init` the first time, it scaffolded a project folder with two kinds of files:

**Your files** — These are yours to customize. `init` will never overwrite them:

| Files | What they do |
|-------|-------------|
| `config/SOUL.md`, `EVENT_HANDLER.md`, `AGENT.md`, etc. | Your agent's personality, behavior, and prompts |
| `config/CRONS.json`, `TRIGGERS.json` | Your scheduled jobs and webhook triggers |
| `app/` | Next.js pages and UI components |
| `docker/job/` | The Dockerfile for your agent's job container |

**Managed files** — These are infrastructure files that need to stay in sync with the package version. `init` auto-updates them for you:

| Files | What they do |
|-------|-------------|
| `.github/workflows/` | GitHub Actions that run jobs, auto-merge PRs, rebuild on deploy |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Defines how your containers run together (Traefik, event handler, runner) |
| `docker/event-handler/` | The Dockerfile for the event handler container |
| `.dockerignore` | Keeps unnecessary files out of Docker builds |

#### What happens when you run `init`

1. **Managed files** are updated automatically to match the new package version
2. **Your files** are left alone — but if the package ships new defaults (e.g., a new field in `CRONS.json`), `init` lets you know:

```
Updated templates available:
These files differ from the current package templates.

  config/CRONS.json

To view differences:  npx thepopebot diff <file>
To reset to default:  npx thepopebot reset <file>
```

You can review at your own pace:

```bash
npx thepopebot diff config/CRONS.json    # see what changed
npx thepopebot reset config/CRONS.json   # accept the new template
```

#### If you've modified managed files

If you've made custom changes to managed files (e.g., added extra steps to a GitHub Actions workflow), use `--no-managed` so `init` doesn't overwrite your changes:

```bash
npx thepopebot init --no-managed
```

## CLI Commands

All commands are run via `npx thepopebot <command>` (or the `npm run` shortcuts where noted).

**Project setup:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `init` | Scaffold a new project, or update templates in an existing one |
| `setup` | Run the full interactive setup wizard (`npm run setup`) |
| `setup-telegram` | Reconfigure the Telegram webhook (`npm run setup-telegram`) |
| `reset-auth` | Regenerate AUTH_SECRET, invalidating all sessions |

**Templates:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `diff [file]` | List files that differ from package templates, or diff a specific file |
| `reset [file]` | List all template files, or restore a specific one to package default |

**Secrets & variables:**

These commands set individual GitHub repository secrets/variables using the `gh` CLI. They read `GH_OWNER` and `GH_REPO` from your `.env`. If VALUE is omitted, you'll be prompted with masked input (keeps secrets out of shell history).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `set-agent-secret KEY [VALUE]` | Set `AGENT_<KEY>` GitHub secret and update `.env` |
| `set-agent-llm-secret KEY [VALUE]` | Set `AGENT_LLM_<KEY>` GitHub secret |
| `set-var KEY [VALUE]` | Set a GitHub repository variable |

GitHub secrets use a prefix convention so the workflow can route them correctly:

- **`AGENT_`** — Protected secrets passed to the Docker container (filtered from LLM). Example: `AGENT_GH_TOKEN`, `AGENT_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **`AGENT_LLM_`** — LLM-accessible secrets (not filtered). Example: `AGENT_LLM_BRAVE_API_KEY`
- **No prefix** — Workflow-only secrets, never passed to container. Example: `GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

---

## Template File Conventions

The `templates/` directory contains files scaffolded into user projects by `thepopebot init`. Two naming conventions handle files that npm or AI tools would otherwise misinterpret:

**`.template` suffix** — Files ending in `.template` are scaffolded with the suffix stripped. This is used for files that npm mangles (`.gitignore`) or that AI tools would pick up as real project docs (`CLAUDE.md`).

| In `templates/` | Scaffolded as |
|-----------------|---------------|
| `.gitignore.template` | `.gitignore` |
| `CLAUDE.md.template` | `CLAUDE.md` |
| `api/CLAUDE.md.template` | `api/CLAUDE.md` |

**`CLAUDE.md` exclusion** — The scaffolding walker skips any file named `CLAUDE.md` (without the `.template` suffix). This is a safety net so a bare `CLAUDE.md` accidentally added to `templates/` never gets copied into user projects where AI tools would confuse it with real project instructions.

## Security

thepopebot includes API key authentication, webhook secret validation (fail-closed), session encryption, secret filtering in the Docker agent, and auto-merge path restrictions. However, all software carries risk — thepopebot is provided as-is, and you are responsible for securing your own infrastructure. If you're running locally with a tunnel (ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel, port forwarding), be aware that your dev server endpoints are publicly accessible with no rate limiting and no TLS on the local hop.

See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for full details on what's exposed, the risks, and recommendations.
