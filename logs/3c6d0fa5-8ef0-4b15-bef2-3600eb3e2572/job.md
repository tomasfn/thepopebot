Create a test file at `tests/github-actions-test.txt` with the current timestamp and a success message. The file should contain:
- Current date/time
- A message: "GitHub Actions is working correctly"
- The job run ID if available from environment variables

After creating the file, commit it with the message "test: verify GitHub Actions workflow".

This is a simple test to confirm the Actions workflow pipeline is functioning.
